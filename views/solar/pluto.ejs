        <p>
            Although Pluto was discovered in 1930, limited information on the
            distant object delayed a realistic understanding of its characteristics.
            Pluto is the second largest known dwarf planet and tenth largest orbiting
            the Sun. From its time of discovery in 1930 to 2006 it was considered
            to be the ninth planet in the solar system, but because additional
            objects have been discovered including <b >Eris</b>
            which is 27% more massive, the IAU reclassified Pluto and the other
            objects as dwarf planets.
            The New Horizons spacecraft was launched on January 16, 2006 and will
            make its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015.
            This mission will provide an increased amount of information about
            this peculiar dwarf planet. The uniqueness of Pluto's orbit, rotational
            relationship with its satellite, spin axis, and light variations
            all give it a certain appeal.
        </p><p>
        Pluto is usually farther from the Sun than any of the eight planets;
        however, due to the eccentricity of its orbit, it is closer than
        Neptune for 20 years out of its 249 year orbit.  Pluto crossed
        Neptune's orbit January 21, 1979, made its closest approach
        September 5, 1989, and remained within the orbit of Neptune
        until February 11, 1999.  This will not occur again until September
        2226.
    </p><p>
        As Pluto approaches <b >perihelion</b>
        it reaches its maximum distance from
        the <b >ecliptic</b> due to its 17-degree inclination.  Thus, it is far
        above or below the plane of Neptune's orbit.  Under these conditions,
        Pluto and Neptune will not collide and do not approach closer than 18
        A.U. to one another.
    </p><p>
        Pluto's rotation period is 6.387 days, the same as its satellite
        Charon.  Although it is common for a satellite to travel in a
        <b >synchronous orbit</b> with its planet, Pluto
        rotates synchronously with the orbit of its satellite.  Thus being
        tidally locked, Pluto and Charon continuously face each other as
        they travel through space.
    </p><p>
        Unlike most planets, but similar to Uranus, Pluto rotates with its
        poles almost in its orbital plane. Pluto's rotational axis is tipped
        122 degrees.  When Pluto was first discovered, its relatively bright
        south polar region was the view seen from the Earth. Pluto appeared
        to grow dim as our viewpoint gradually shifted from nearly pole-on
        in 1954 to nearly equator-on in 1973.  Pluto's equator is now the
        view seen from Earth.
    </p><p>
        During the period from 1985 through 1990, Earth was aligned with the
        orbit of Charon around Pluto such that an <b >eclipse</b> could be observed
        every Pluto day.  This provided opportunity to collect significant
        data which led to <b >albedo</b> maps defining surface reflectivity, and to
        the first accurate determination of the sizes of Pluto and Charon,
        including all the numbers that could be calculated therefrom.
    </p><p>
        The first eclipses (mutual events) began blocking the north polar
        region.  Later eclipses blocked the equatorial region, and final
        eclipses blocked Pluto's south polar region.  By carefully
        measuring the brightness over time, it was possible to determine
        surface features.  It was found that Pluto has a highly reflective
        south polar cap, a dimmer north polar cap, and both bright and
        dark features in the equatorial region.  Pluto's geometric albedo
        is 0.49 to 0.66, which is much brighter than Charon. Charon's
        albedo ranges from 0.36 to 0.39.
    </p><p>
        The eclipses lasted as much as four hours and by carefully timing
        their beginning and ending, measurements for their diameters were
        taken.  The diameters can also be measured directly to within about
        1 percent by more recent images provided by the Hubble Space
        Telescope.  These images resolve the objects to clearly show two
        separate disks.  The improved optics allow us to measure Pluto's
        diameter as 2,274 kilometers (1413 miles) and Charon's diameter as
        1,172 kilometers (728 miles), just over half the size of Pluto. Their
        average separation is 19,640 km (12,200 miles). That's roughly eight
        Pluto diameters.
    </p><p>
        Average separation and orbital period are used to calculate Pluto and
        Charon's masses.  Pluto's mass is about 6.4 x 10<sup>-9</sup> solar masses.
        This is close to 7 (was 12 x's) times the mass of Charon and
        approximately 0.0021 Earth mass, or a fifth of our moon.
    </p><p>
        Pluto's average density lies between 1.8 and 2.1 grams per cubic
        centimeter. It is concluded that Pluto is 50% to 75% rock mixed
        with ices.  Charon's density is 1.2 to 1.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, indicating it
        contains little rock.  The differences in density tell us that
        Pluto and Charon formed independently, although Charon's numbers
        derived from HST data are still being challenged by ground based
        observations.  Pluto and Charon's origin remains in the realm of theory.
    </p><p>
        Pluto's icy surface is 98% nitrogen (N2).  Methane (CH4) and
        traces of carbon monoxide (CO) are also present.  The solid
        methane indicates that Pluto is colder than 70 Kelvin.  Pluto's
        temperature varies widely during the course of its orbit since
        Pluto can be as close to the sun as 30 AU and as far away as 50
        AU.  There is a thin atmosphere that freezes and falls to the
        surface as the planet moves away from the Sun. The atmospheric
        pressure deduced for Pluto's surface is 1/100,000 that of Earth's
        surface pressure.
    </p><p>
        Pluto was officially labeled the ninth planet by the International
        Astronomical Union in 1930 and named for the Roman god of the
        underworld.  It was the first and only planet to be discovered by
        an American, Clyde W. Tombaugh. It has since been reclassified
        as a Dwarf Planet along with <b >Eris</b> and
        <b >Ceres</b>.
    </p><p>
        The path toward its discovery is credited to Percival Lowell who
        founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona and funded
        three separate searches for "Planet X."  Lowell made numerous
        unsuccessful calculations to find it, believing it could be
        detected from the effect it would have on Neptune's orbit.  Dr.
        Vesto Slipher, the observatory director, hired Clyde Tombaugh
        for the third search and Clyde took sets of photographs of the
        plane of the solar system (ecliptic) one to two weeks apart and
        looked for anything that shifted against the backdrop of stars.
        This systematic approach was successful and Pluto was discovered
        by this young (born 4 Feb 1906) 24 year old Kansas lab assistant
        on February 18, 1930.  Pluto is actually too small to be the
        "Planet X" Percival Lowell had hoped to find.  Pluto's was a
        serendipitous discovery.
